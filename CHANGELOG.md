## [v7.0.0] - 2021-10-04

## Breaking Changes

This version of the dashboard requires Cumulus API `v9.5.0`

- **CUMULUS-2502**
  - Configuration changes are required to continue connecting the dashboard with Earthdata Metrics
  - Metrics integration has been updated to require manual configuration rather
    than by an assumed naming convention. As such, new environmental variables
    describing the Elasticsearch target patterns have been added (check with
    your metrics provider for the exact values):
    - ES_CLOUDWATCH_TARGET_PATTERN (Generally: `<daac>-cumulus-cloudwatch-<env>-*`)
    - ES_DISTRIBUTION_TARGET_PATTERN (Generally: `<daac>-distribution-<env>-*`)
  - Kibana links are changed. We no longer try to build URLs that describe the
    metrics' Elasticsearch results. Instead, we now only return a simple link to
    configured Kibana root. It is up to the kibana user to interact with the
    dashboard, setting default security tenant and default kibana index
    patterns. You can create kibana Index Patterns (or they may exist already)
    to gather the cloudwatch logs sent to metrics with a similar patter to the
    ES_CLOUDWATCH_TARGET_PATTERN, and if you have configured s3 server access
    logs, likewise use a pattern like the ES_DISTRIBUTION_TARGET_PATTERN.
- **CUMULUS-2459**
  - Use of `executions/search-by-granules` to retrieve executions for a granule/collection
    combination requires minimum CUMULUS API v9.5.0

## [v1.5.0] - 2019-08-26

### BREAKING CHANGES

- You must be using Cumulus API version >= v1.14.0 in order to use the new
  distribution metrics functionality.

### Added

- **CUMULUS-1337**
  - Must use Cumulus API version v1.14.0 or above in order to use the new
    distribution metrics functionality.
  - Distribution metrics are no longer served from the Cumulus API, but are
    computed from the logs in an ELK stack.
  - If you want to display distribution metrics using a Kibana instance (ELK
    stack), you need to set the environment variables `KIBANAROOT` to point to
    the base url of an accessible Kibana instance as well as `ESROOT` to the
    Elastic Search endpoint holding your metrics.
  - The `KIBANAROOT` will be used to generate links to the kibana discovery page
    to interrogate errors/successes further.
  - The `ESROOT` is used to query Elasticsearch directly to retrieve the
    displayed counts.
  - For information on setting up the Cumulus Distribution API Logs and S3
    Server Access see the [Cumulus Distribution Metrics documentation].
  - See this project's `README.md` for instructions on setting up development
    access for Kibana and Elasticsearch.
